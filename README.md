Windows10/11 Automatic Backup Creation and Revertchanges Scripts

This Repository contains powershell scripts, to backup your powercfg, Registry and bcdconfig, in a folder on your C:\ Drive.
It further contains scripts that can use these Backup Files to Revert changes made in the meantime. 
Allowing you to save these settings not using the crappy windows backup funktion that seems to break more than it fixes. 

-Please note that you have to allow script execution to run these scripts.

Best regards.
