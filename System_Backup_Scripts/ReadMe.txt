Please Use These Scripts to create Backups of important settings and Files before making Changes.

You can use the CreateSystemBackups.ps1 to automaticly create backups of your powercfg, Bcdeditconfig and Registry.
Backup files will by default be saved to : C:\BACKUPS\...


In the RevertChanges folder youll find scripts that can then use the created Backup files to Revert any Changes later.

Just run the Revert script for the settings you want to revert. Then choose the created Backup file you want to use, to revert all changes made in the meantime.

Please note that these Backups do not cover all Settings of your System. But arguably the most important.
If youre unsure you can also create a system backup using Windows just to be supersafe.

Best regards
